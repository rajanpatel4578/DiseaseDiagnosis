Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 80 year old man with stuttering symptoms of left
hand weakness and numbness, right monocular visual loss. He has
moderate risk factors with possible hypercholesterolemia and
tobacco use. Neurologic exam is essentially normal. MRI showed
poorly visualized right intracranial carotid, and scattered
diffusion restriction and FLAIR in right corona radiata in
watershed pattern. MRA shows poorly visualized right
intracranial carotid. He was admitted to the Neurology Service
for work up and management of stuttering/crescendo transient
ischemic attack.

Patient was started on heparin with goal PTT 50-70Head of bed
flat to enhance perfusion. Carotid ultrasound showed
hemodynamically significant plaque in right internal carotid
artery. He was seen by neurosurgery re: possible stenting of
carotid lesion given its symptomatic nature. He underwent
successful stenting on [**2156-3-26**] with no complications.

In terms of risk factor modification, he underwent an
echocardiogram. This demonstrated normal ejection fraction, no
intraluminal clot, no atrial septal defect or patent foramen
ovale. He ruled out for MI. Telemetry monitoring showed frequent
premature atrial beats, but no hemodynamically significant
arrhythmias. Lipid panel showed total cholesterol of 198,
triglycerides of 107, HDL 52 and LDL 125. He was started on
Lipitor for goal LDL<70. Hemoglobin A1c was within normal range
at 5.3.

On discharge, patient had no neurological deficits. He will
continue on full strength aspirin and Plavix daily to prevent
thrombosis or in-stent restenosis of his carotid stent. He will
get a repeat carotid ultrasound this week to ensure stent
patency.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo man with CHF and low EF (10-15%), A fib on coumadin s/p recent
   ablation, CKD on HD s/p fall c/b subarachnoid hemorrhage, C6-C7
   widening w/o fracture, left thigh hematoma, found to have b/l pleural
   effusions and pericardial effusion.
   .
   # Pericardial effusion/pericardial tamponade: believed to be chronic
   due to size; perhaps secondary to uremia (requiring dialysis),
   complication from pacemaker placement (bleed/trauma), or due to viral
   pericarditis (patient had URI recently) or less likely due to
   malignancy; s/p pericardiocentesis.  No evidence of infection at this
   time.  Given high RBC ct in fluid, suspect that it may be slow bleed
   from prior trauma from pacemaker placement.
   -Once drain <25-50 cc drainage/24 hours, will remove; to be flushed
   today (150 overnight)
   - no antiplatelets, will go on heparin gtt for LUE DVT (neurosx aware)
   - continue q4 heparin flushes of drain
   - follow output and pull drain when output tapers off
   - f/u pericardial fluid culture
   - consider indomethacin if needed for pericardial pain
   - monitor on telemetry
   - f/u TTE for evaluation of residual pericardial fluid; possible repeat
   echo today
   .
   # Dilated cardiomyopathy
   - On carvedilol, off metoprolol
    - Consider adding ACE-I or [**Last Name (un) **] in near future.
   .
   # Respiratory status: Patient with pleural effusions; now satting well
   and comfortable on shovel mask.  CXR shows persistent effusions,
   atelectasis
   - consider thoracentesis if respiratory status worsens and effusions
   worsen
   - O2 wean as tolerated
   - not diuresing given tamponade physiology
   .
   # s/p liver transplant:  sirolimus level low today.  Discussed with

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Severely depressed LVEF.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: basal inferior
- hypo; mid inferior - hypo; basal inferolateral - akinetic; mid inferolateral
- akinetic; basal anterolateral - akinetic; mid anterolateral - akinetic;
inferior apex - hypo; lateral apex - akinetic;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV free wall thickness. Dilated RV cavity. Severe
global RV free wall hypokinesis.

AORTIC VALVE: ?# aortic valve leaflets. Moderately thickened aortic valve
leaflets.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. Eccentric MR jet. Moderate to
severe (3+) MR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality as the patient was difficult to
position. Suboptimal image quality - ventilator. The patient is in a
ventricularly paced rhythm. Echocardiographic results were reviewed with the
houseofficer caring for the patient. Bilateral pleural effusions.

Conclusions:
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed. The right
ventricular free wall thickness is normal. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. An eccentric,
posteriorly directed jet of Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 680**] was notified in person of the

 PORTABLE CHEST, [**2149-6-22**]

 INDICATION:  Fever.  Questionable increase in mediastinum.

 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray [**2149-6-21**] and multiple prior chest radiographs
 dating back to [**2149-6-1**].

 FINDINGS:  The cardiac and mediastinal contours appear widened, but are stable
 in appearance compared to a similarly positioned chest radiograph of [**2149-6-1**].  Tracheostomy tube, right PICC line and feeding tube are in standard
 positions.  There has been development of bilateral perihilar haziness, likely
 due to pulmonary edema.  Previously noted areas of consolidation in the right
 lung show slight improvement with residual opacities with a more nodular
 appearance than before.  Dense left retrocardiac opacity is without change.
 There is an unusual metallic density adjacent to the lowest sternal wire,
 projecting in the left lower lobe on prior CT torso of [**2149-6-19**].  This is
 reportedly due to embolization of an AVM.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New mild perihilar edema.

 2.  Slightly improved consolidation in the right mid and lower lung regions,
 likely due to pneumonia.  Somewhat nodular appearance in this area on the
 current study raises the possibility of septic emboli.

   82 YO male presented with abdominal pain & is found to have
   pancreatitis & acute on renal failure. S/P ERCP which revealed
   gallstone obstructive pancreatitis & s/p sphincterotomy on [**9-16**],
   intubated post procedure due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. NGT in
   place for GI decompression. If remains NPO/intubated in the next 24hrs,
   recommend tube feeds via PPFT or NJ tube given pancreatitis. Goal tube
   feed would be Novasource Renal at goal 45mL/hr, providing 2160kcals &
   80g protein.
   Medical Nutrition Therapy Plan - Recommend the Following
   1.       If remains NPO/Intubated in the next 24hrs, place PPFT or NJ &
   start tube feed at 10mL/hr of Novasource Renal, advance by 10mL every
   4hrs to goal 45mL/hr
   2.       Monitor tube feed tolerance via abdominal exam & stool output
   (do not check residuals)
   3.       Adjust free water flushes per hydration
   4.       Monitor labs daily & replete PRN
   Will follow plan & progress.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo F with dementia/schizophrenia, Lower extremity paralysis, DM,
   COPD presenting with fever and lethargy found to be in septic shock.
   Source unclear, but UTI seems most likely at this point.  Sacral decub
   unlikely to be the cause.
   1.) Septic shock:  Currently with CVP of 12 with minimal respiratory
   variation on tracing.  MAP >60 on levophed, CVO2 sat >70%
   -Agree with broad coverage with Vanc/Zosyn (has had h/o VSE/MRSA/e coli
   resistent to quinolones in the urine in the past).
   -Follow up cultures
   -Maintain CVP 8-12
   -Titrate pressors to MAP >60
   -CVO2 > 70, no need for inotropes at present.  HCT >30
   2.) Sacral Decubitus:
     -Local wound care
   3.) COPD:
      -Continue flovent, combivent.  No need for systemic steroids at
   present
   4.) Schizophrenia:  continue olanzapine
   5.) FEN:  TF only. Known to aspirate when attempting swallow per NH.
   6.) Transaminitis:  Mildly elevated.  Non-tender on exam.  [**Month (only) 60**] be
   related to hypoperfusion

 PROVISIONAL FINDINGS IMPRESSION (PFI): JKPe MON [**2100-10-4**] 10:51 PM
  PFI:  Probable sinusitis with aerosolized secretions within the sphenoid
  sinuses bilaterally, right posterior ethmoid sinus, and left mastoid air
  cells.  Clinical correlation is needed to exclude acute mastoiditis.
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  [**Doctor First Name **] and fever with prolonged intubation.  Evaluate for signs of
 acute sinusitis.

 [**2100-9-30**] and [**2100-9-27**] head CTs.

 TECHNIQUE:  CT of the facial bones.

 FINDINGS:  There are aerosolized secretions and mucosal thickening noted
 within the sphenoid sinuses bilaterally as well as the posterior right ethmoid
 air cells, decreased compared to [**2100-9-30**] head CT. There is moderate mucosal
 thickening in the left maxillary sinus, similar to [**2100-9-27**]. There is minimal
 mucosal thickening in the right maxillary sinus. The frontal sinuses are
 normally aerated. The ostiomeatal complexes are patent. The nasal septum is
 deviated to the left with a bone spur.

 Opacification of the left mastoid air cells is unchanged, without evidence
 of osseous erosion.

 Aerosolized secretions in the oropharynx are likely related to underlying
 intubation.

 IMPRESSION:
 1. Aerosolized secretions in the right posterior ethmoid and both sphenoid
 sinuses, decreased since [**9-30**]. While these findings may be seen in intubated
 patients, acute sinusitis cannot be excluded.

 2. Persistent opacification of the left mastoid air cells, without evidence of
 osseous destruction, which may be seen in intubated patients. Clinical
 correlation is needed to exclude acute mastoiditis.

 HISTORY:  This is a 77-year-old man status post left femoral to popliteal
 bypass.

 RADIOLOGIST:  The study was read by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 766**] [**Name (STitle) 192**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 134**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 135**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Noninvasive arterial evaluation of the lower extremities was
 performed with Doppler, pulse volume recording and segmental limb pressure
 measurements.

 FINDINGS: On the right side triphasic waveforms were seen at the femoral,
 popliteal, posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis artery levels. Pulse volume
 recording showed normal amplitudes and segmental limb pressure measurements
 did not show abnormal decrease.  The right ABI was 1.37.
 On the left side, triphasic waveforms were seen at the femoral, popliteal and
 posterior tibial levels.  However, monophasic waveforms were seen at the
 dorsalis pedis artery level.  PVRs showed normal amplitude on the left side.
 The left ABI was 0.98.

 IMPRESSION:  Mild arterial disease in the left dorsalis pedis artery
 territory.

History of Present Illness:
41yo RH M h/o idiopathic generalized tonic clonic seizures who
presents after having seven of them today. His first was at
6:30am on waking, lasting one min. He fell asleep after. He
subsequently had 6 more seizures throughout the day, all typical
for his generalized event and not preceeded by aura. The second
was at 8:30am and threw him out of bed but without significant
injury. He missed his am meds due to N/V but was groggy yet
interactive. At 11am he seized again, also 1min and afterwards
was disoriented for a bit of time. He then got up and went about
his day. His subsequent seizures were at 2pm, 2:45 and 3:20pm;
in between the latter two he was moaning and moving around in
bed.
On arrival here, he was awake, alert and agitated to the point
of needing to be restrained. He was given ativan 2mg IV at
5:50pm and has not seized since (it is now 7:30pm).
Please see Dr.[**Name (NI) 17796**] prior note for further details of
his history. In brief, he presented with two GTCs in [**5-10**] and
was started on DPH. He was switched to ZNS. He had a third
seizure in [**Month (only) 1096**] off of medications and was restarted on ZNS.
He has since then increased and decreased his dose on his own
[**Location (un) **] but most recently was seen in clinic in [**2116-9-5**] and
maintained on
ZNS 300mg daily. He was then started on lamictal and due to
titrate up to 75mg [**Hospital1 **] last week. His wife is unsure if this was
done.

ROS: On review of systems, the pt's wife denied recent fever or
chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denied
cough, shortness of breath.  Denied chest pain or tightness,
palpitations.  Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation
or abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
 No dysuria.  Denied arthralgias or myalgias. Denied rash.

EEG:
Mildly abnormal EEG due to the infrequent subtle slowing in the
right fronto-central region. This suggests a focal subcortical
dysfunction in the right hemisphere, but there was no area of
persistent slowing. There were no epileptiform features.

MRI:
Similar focal T2-hyperintensity within the right mastoid air
cells, likely inflammatory in origin. Please note that
evaluation is quite limited by motion artifact and that axial
T2-weighted and post-contrast imaging sequences were not
performed.

CXR:
No definite evidence for aspiration, pneumonia or other acute
cardiopulmonary process.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 17797**] was admitted to the ICU for closer monitoring. He
was broadly cultured and empirically started on CTX, Vanco and
acyclovir. He had been loaded with dilantin in the ED. He did
not have further seizures during his admission. The following
day he had an LP. It had been attempted unsuccessfully earlier.
This showed elevated WBC and Protein but normal glucose. The
gram stain and culture were negative as was an HSV PCR. An MRI
did not show any pathology. He remained clinically stable and a
PICC was placed to treat empirically for bacterial meningitis as
the culture was obtained after 24 hours of antibiotics. He will
complete a 14 day course of vanco and CXT.  His dilantin was
tapered prior to discharge and he will taper the Lamictal as an
outpatient. He was also seen by psychiatry for emotional
lability and no treatment intervention was recommended. He will
follow-up with Neurology and psychiatry as an outpatient.
